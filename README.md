# Heat distribution equation
 A code using python that executes a problem of heat distribution for the calculus 4 class in college.

This is a code that I developed with some friends using python. This was a task, a work that the teacher asked us to do at calculus 4 class to send her in about 1 week. 

We used the python language to develop the code because it is the first programming language we learn in college and we all know how to code it. 

This task was based on a document which the teacher sent that commanded the students to make a code that could take some values in a hipotetic wall that had for example lenght, temperature and diffusivity. We took the values and transformed into variables and made the algorithm that could read and execute the operations required. 

We used dx and dy as our parametres and determined as 0.05 and 0.01 in option a) and 0.05 and 0.05 in option b). The code also shows a graphic of situation a) and how the heat distribution works in a wall with those characteristics. There is no graphic in situation b) because its values does not meet its requirements.
